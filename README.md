# IOFactory Assignment 2
**MAX PROFIT PROBLEM**


Intuition: 


-> At the first look at the question, I thought of going with greedy approach. Taking the property which has the highest earnings in a given time. But under some condition it failed.

-> So, I thought of trying out all the combinations of the properties and come up with the solution which gave the maximum earnings.

-> I came up with the recursive approach to solve this problem.

-> Here I have given the recursive solution and then improved the space complexity by using dynamic programming.

-> I have added both the solutions in Solution 1 and Solution 2 files. Solution 2 being the most optimal with **_TC:O(N*timeUnit)_** and **_SC:O(N*timeUnit)_**
